//! # libcapstone.so.3 bindings

//! If you want to compile this for another target,  `wasm32-unknown-emscripten`, for example,
//! it is currently recommended to pass the feature flag `build_src_cmake` to
//! build capstone using the cmake build system (which requires cmake to be installed).
//!
//! This has seen some (limited) testing and has been seen to work on the `wasm32-unknown-emscripten` target at least.
//!
//! Compiling on windows has not been tested, although this should be easy to setup.
